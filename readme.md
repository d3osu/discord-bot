The two games under development here _Pitch Deck_ and _Silicon Valley Startups_. The game rules are detailed here, as well as instructions to manage and play the different games. The commands and behavior of the game are also found her.

#### Pitch Deck

Pitch deck is a game about convincing your friends to invest in the most ridiculous startups imaginable. Each round, everyone combines a Pitch Card from their hand with a company card on the table to create a new business, like Uber for piggyback rides or Tinder: The Musical.

Then, everyone makes a quick elevator pitch describing their businesses and why you should invest in it. A different person plays the lead investor each round, who decides which idea everybody will secretly fund based on how compelling the pitch was. Once everyone has been the Lead Investor once,the funding amounts are revealed and totaled. 

There are two winners: the person who pitched the most valuable company and the person who invested the most in that company. 

##### Getting Started

Everyone draws a hand of 8 Pitch Cards and takes a stack of 8 funding cards form one of the game's venture capital funds. The VC's all have the same investment amounts printed on their tiles, so people should feel free to chose one based on which they like (or dislike?) the most. 

##### Playing the game

*Making pitches*: The Lead Investor draws 3 Company cards and reads each name out loud. Then they pick the company they want to hear pitches for, e.g. LinkedIn. Discord the other two cards. 

Everyone else chooses a Pitch card from their hand to pair with that company, e.g. LinkedIn for "Babies" or LinkedIn for "The profoundly lazy."

Starting with the person to the Lead Investor's left, going clockwise, eveyyhon gives a quick elevator pitch for their brilliantly awful business idea. It can be as short as a single word, or as long as a minute or two. __The Lead Investor does not make a pitch.__ 

After everyone has made their pitch, the Lead Investor decides whose business everyone will fund, and places that Company and Pitch Card pairing in the middle of the table. Their choice can be based on anything, but it's usually given to whoever gave the best or funniest or weirdest pitch.

*Investing*: Everyone draws the top two Funding tiles from their stack, secretly chooses one amount to invest in the winning business, and places that tile face down on the top of the card pairing (so that the amount is secret). Everyone reshuffles the tile they didn't choose back into their stack. __The person whose pitch won does not invest this round.__

Everyone except the Lead Investor draws a replacement Pitch card, so you always have 8 cards in your hand to choose from. The player to the left of the current Lead Investor becomes the new Lead Investor. 

*Scoring*: After everyone has been Lead Investor once, reveal and add up the investment amount, going one company at a time (to build tension). There are two winners: the person who pitched the company with the highest total funding is the winning founder, and the person who invested the most in that company is the winning investor. Either play again or actually go start that company.

##### Finicky Rules

*Pivoting*: Every card in Pitch deck is hilarious and good. But if someone incorrectly doesn't like the cards they have in their hand, once per game they can disard their hand and draw 8 new cards. 

*Co-Founders*: In the unlikely event you have enough friends to play with 9+ people we commend playing in 2-person(ish) teams. Everyone has their own hand, but you pitch as a team and collectively decide on cards, tiles, and who wins pitches. 

*Pitch Off*: It's possible that a game will end in a tie for one or both winners. When this happens, just like in real business, it immediately triggers a Pitch Off. Draw a company card from the top of the deck and give each tied player a single Pitch card to play - but they can't look at it until immediately before they start their pitch. After the tied players decide their pitches, everyone votes on who wom. 

##### Some tips and tricks

+ When in doubt: Keep it simple, stupid. 
+ Don't immediately reveal your pitch. Hint at it, build suspense, and when you finally do reveal it, flip your card over theatrically at the same time.
+ If you're having trouble ending a bad pitch, just awkwardly look down, say "Thanks for your time," and slink away in mock shame.
+ The notes at the bottom of the pitch cards are helpful for steeping yourself in the bullshit of tech culture - try adapting the terms for your pitches.
+ As the Lead Investor, if you see someone losing steam on a pitch, you can cut them off, politely, by groaning and saying "Thanks for coming in!"
+ Everyone at the table should feel free to ask the person pitching follow up questions, or even add onto the idea, assuming you're having fun and it's in the spirit of "yes, and..."
+ Don't be competitive about funding: it's a little random on purpose, because the game works better if people play in good faith and just reward the most interesting, creative pitches.
+ Poeple are putting themselves on the line to make you laugh: be supportive!!
