The two games under development here _Pitch Deck_ and _Silicon Valley Startups_. The game rules are detailed here as they are shown in the physical deck, as well as instructions to play the different games. The commands and Discord setup for the games are embedded in the rules. The game will also provide information in its corresponding text channel.
### **Pitch Deck**

Pitch deck is a game about convincing your friends to invest in the most ridiculous startups imaginable. Each round, everyone combines a Pitch Card from their hand with a company card on the table to create a new business, like Uber for piggyback rides or Tinder: The Musical.

Then, everyone makes a quick elevator pitch describing their businesses and why you should invest in it. A different person plays the lead investor each round, who decides which idea everybody will secretly fund based on how compelling the pitch was. Once everyone has been the Lead Investor once,the funding amounts are revealed and totaled. 

There are two winners: the person who pitched the most valuable company and the person who invested the most in that company. 

#### **Getting Started**

Everyone draws a hand of 8 Pitch Cards and takes a stack of 8 funding cards form one of the game's venture capital funds. The VC's all have the same investment amounts printed on their tiles, so people should feel free to chose one based on which they like (or dislike?) the most. 

#### **Playing the Game**

*Making pitches*: The Lead Investor draws 3 Company cards and reads each name out loud. Then they pick the company they want to hear pitches for, e.g. LinkedIn. Discord the other two cards. 

Everyone else chooses a Pitch card from their hand to pair with that company, e.g. LinkedIn for "Babies" or LinkedIn for "The profoundly lazy."

Starting with the person to the Lead Investor's left, going clockwise, eveyyhon gives a quick elevator pitch for their brilliantly awful business idea. It can be as short as a single word, or as long as a minute or two. __The Lead Investor does not make a pitch.__ 

After everyone has made their pitch, the Lead Investor decides whose business everyone will fund, and places that Company and Pitch Card pairing in the middle of the table. Their choice can be based on anything, but it's usually given to whoever gave the best or funniest or weirdest pitch.

*Investing*: Everyone draws the top two Funding tiles from their stack, secretly chooses one amount to invest in the winning business, and places that tile face down on the top of the card pairing (so that the amount is secret). Everyone reshuffles the tile they didn't choose back into their stack. __The person whose pitch won does not invest this round.__

Everyone except the Lead Investor draws a replacement Pitch card, so you always have 8 cards in your hand to choose from. The player to the left of the current Lead Investor becomes the new Lead Investor. 

*Scoring*: After everyone has been Lead Investor once, reveal and add up the investment amount, going one company at a time (to build tension). There are two winners: the person who pitched the company with the highest total funding is the winning founder, and the person who invested the most in that company is the winning investor. Either play again or actually go start that company.

#### **Finicky Rules**

*Pivoting*: Every card in Pitch deck is hilarious and good. But if someone incorrectly doesn't like the cards they have in their hand, once per game they can disard their hand and draw 8 new cards. 

*Co-Founders*: In the unlikely event you have enough friends to play with 9+ people we commend playing in 2-person(ish) teams. Everyone has their own hand, but you pitch as a team and collectively decide on cards, tiles, and who wins pitches. 

*Pitch Off*: It's possible that a game will end in a tie for one or both winners. When this happens, just like in real business, it immediately triggers a Pitch Off. Draw a company card from the top of the deck and give each tied player a single Pitch card to play - but they can't look at it until immediately before they start their pitch. After the tied players decide their pitches, everyone votes on who wom. 

#### **Some Tips and Tricks**

+ When in doubt: Keep it simple, stupid. 
+ Don't immediately reveal your pitch. Hint at it, build suspense, and when you finally do reveal it, flip your card over theatrically at the same time.
+ If you're having trouble ending a bad pitch, just awkwardly look down, say "Thanks for your time," and slink away in mock shame.
+ The notes at the bottom of the pitch cards are helpful for steeping yourself in the bullshit of tech culture - try adapting the terms for your pitches.
+ As the Lead Investor, if you see someone losing steam on a pitch, you can cut them off, politely, by groaning and saying "Thanks for coming in!"
+ Everyone at the table should feel free to ask the person pitching follow up questions, or even add onto the idea, assuming you're having fun and it's in the spirit of "yes, and..."
+ Don't be competitive about funding: it's a little random on purpose, because the game works better if people play in good faith and just reward the most interesting, creative pitches.
+ Poeple are putting themselves on the line to make you laugh: be supportive!!

### **Silicon Valley Startups**

Silicon Valley is silimar to Pitch Deck, as it is a hilarious game of pitching crazy companies. Entrerpreneurs must think on their feet and convince an Investor to fund their startup company. The player with the most successful pitches wins the game!

#### **Set It Up**

Pick a player (or team of players if you have a large group) to be the first Investor. They will be listening to the pitches for the first round. Have them shuffle the _HOT TREND_ deck and set it face-down in front of them.

The other players will be Entrepreneurs. Shuffle the other three decks separately and set them face-down in the middle of the table in this order: _COMPANY NAME, TARGET USER, and INDUSTRY_.

**COMPANY NAME Cards**: 

COMPANY NAME cards have instructions for creating the name. If it includes the words "ASK FOR" that means you must ask for the group to provide something for you.

For example: A same card reads _Ask for a flavor + "MAZE"_. You then ask the group for a flavor. If someone replies "chocolate," your company name will be _Chocolate Maze_. 

#### **Time to Pitch**

**SINGLE OWNER**: (_Recommended for 3-4 players_)
Starting with the player to the Investor's left. each Entrepreneur pitches, one at a time, following the steps **in this order**: 

1.  Draw 2 _COMPANY NAME_ cards and pick one, discarding the other.
2.  Draw 2 _TARGET USER_ cards and pick one, discarding the other.
3.  Draw 2 _INDUSTRY_ cards and pick one, discarding the other.

Pitch your heart out, using all three cards as your guide. The company name, target user and industry must be mentioned in your pitch. Outside of that, anything goes!

**BUT WAIT!!** _There's more._
At the end of each pitch, the Investor gets to ask the Entrepreneur a question to keep them on their toes. The Investor draws 2 _HOT TREND_ cards and picks one, discarding the other. Then, they ask the Entrepreneur how that Hot Trend will be leveraged with their startup. The Entrepreneur now must pivot to answer the question.

**PARTNERS** _(Recommended for 5+ players, up to 4 people per team_.)
Starting with the group to the Investor's left, the group of entrepreneurs pitch, taking turns. If there are less than 4 people, just alternate accordingly so nobody goes twice before everyone in the group goes. **In this order**: 

1.  **First Player** - Draw 2 _COMPANY NAME_ cards and pick one, disarding the other. Create the company name using the instructions printed on the card and start pitching!
2.  **Next Player** - Draw 2 _TARGET USER_ cards and pick one, discarding the other and continue the pitch.
3.  **Next Player** - Draw 2 _INDUSTRY_ cards and pick one, discarding the other and continue the pitch.
4.  **Next Player** - The Investor draws 2 _HOT TREND_ cards and picks one, discarding the other. Then, they ask the next player how the Hot Trend will be leveraged with their startup. Player B must pivot to answer the Hot Trend question.

To ensure players stay on their toes, don't draw the next pitch card until the teammate before you has started talking. For example, The player in charge of pitching the _TARGET USER_ doesn't draw and choose their card until after the first player has started pitching the _COMPANY NAME_. An added twist to make the game more interesting!

**SOME PITCHING TIPS**: 

1.  Start with a big, attention-grabbing opener:
    *   "How would you feel about a company that changes the way we do banking?"
    *   "Imagine some tech that will let you be lazy and more productive!"
2.  You may not know what every card means... and it's okay. Make it up! Pitching with passion and humor is the way to go.
3.  Use the data and number! They don't need to be accurate or make sense. Reciting numbers and percentages makes you sound really, really smart.
4.  Name drop. Of course you met with Elon Musk and he wanted to get involved!

#### **Winning a Round**

After each pitch has been passionately presented, the Investor decides which one they want to invest in. The Entrepreneuer that gets the investment receives one of the _HOT TREND_ cards, using it as a way to keep track of the points.
 
#### **Winning the Game**

After each player has been the Investor twice, the player with the most Hot Trend cards wins the game! In the event of a tie, the tied players play a tie-breaking round. If everyone is tied, go for another full round of everyone playing as the Investor to decide the winners.
